# The Sprintplex website

This project is the design and development of the sprintplex website hosted at [www.sprintplex.com](https://www.sprinplex.com).

The site is built initially using pure HTML and CSS, JavaScript will be added in the future as the need arises.

The site is built with inspiration from Jonas Schmedtmann's CSS course: 'Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More!'. Thanks Jonas.
